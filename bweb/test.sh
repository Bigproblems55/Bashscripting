# Tests and Comparisons: Alternatives
# For tests, the [[ ]] construct may be more appropriate than [ ]. Likewise, arithmetic comparisons might benefit from the (( )) construct.

# All of the comparisons below are equivalent.

# Again, all of the comparisons below are equivalent.

                                  # Greater ASCII order.

                                  # Need not quote $city.
