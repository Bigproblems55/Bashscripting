29.1. /dev
The /dev directory contains entries for the physical devices that may or may not be present in the hardware. [1] Appropriately enough, these are called device files. As an example, the hard drive partitions containing the mounted filesystem(s) have entries in /dev, as df shows.

bash$ df
Filesystem           1k-blocks      Used Available Use%
 Mounted on
 /dev/hda6               495876    222748    247527  48% /
 /dev/hda1                50755      3887     44248   9% /boot
 /dev/hda8               367013     13262    334803   4% /home
 /dev/hda5              1714416   1123624    503704  70% /usr
	      
Among other things, the /dev directory contains loopback devices, such as /dev/loop0. A loopback device is a gimmick that allows an ordinary file to be accessed as if it were a block device. [2] This permits mounting an entire filesystem within a single large file. See Example 17-8 and Example 17-7.

A few of the pseudo-devices in /dev have other specialized uses, such as /dev/null, /dev/zero, /dev/urandom, /dev/sda1 (hard drive partition), /dev/udp (User Datagram Packet port), and /dev/tcp.

For instance:

To manually mount a USB flash drive, append the following line to /etc/fstab. [3]
/dev/sda1    /mnt/flashdrive    auto    noauto,user,noatime    0 0
(See also Example A-23.)

Checking whether a disk is in the CD-burner (soft-linked to /dev/hdc):
head -1 /dev/hdc


#  head: cannot open '/dev/hdc' for reading: No medium found
#  (No disc in the drive.)

#  head: error reading '/dev/hdc': Input/output error
#  (There is a disk in the drive, but it can't be read;
#+  possibly it's an unrecorded CDR blank.)   

#  Stream of characters and assorted gibberish
#  (There is a pre-recorded disk in the drive,
#+ and this is raw output -- a stream of ASCII and binary data.)
#  Here we see the wisdom of using 'head' to limit the output
#+ to manageable proportions, rather than 'cat' or something similar.


#  Now, it's just a matter of checking/parsing the output and taking
#+ appropriate action.


When executing a command on a /dev/tcp/$host/$port pseudo-device file, Bash opens a TCP connection to the associated socket.

A socket is a communications node associated with a specific I/O port. (This is analogous to a hardware socket, or receptacle, for a connecting cable.) It permits data transfer between hardware devices on the same machine, between machines on the same network, between machines across different networks, and, of course, between machines at different locations on the Internet.

The following examples assume an active Internet connection.

Getting the time from nist.gov:

bash$ cat </dev/tcp/time.nist.gov/13
53082 04-03-18 04:26:54 68 0 0 502.3 UTC(NIST) *
	      
[Mark contributed this example.]

Generalizing the above into a script:

#!/bin/bash
# This script must run with root permissions.

URL="time.nist.gov/13"

Time=$(cat </dev/tcp/"$URL")
UTC=$(echo "$Time" | awk '{print$3}')   # Third field is UTC (GMT) time.
# Exercise: modify this for different time zones.

echo "UTC Time = "$UTC""

Downloading a URL:

bash$ exec 5<>/dev/tcp/www.net.cn/80
bash$ echo -e "GET / HTTP/1.0\n" >&5
bash$ cat <&5
	      
[Thanks, Mark and Mihai Maties.]

Example 29-1. Using /dev/tcp for troubleshooting

#!/bin/bash
# dev-tcp.sh: /dev/tcp redirection to check Internet connection.

# Script by Troy Engel.
# Used with permission.
 
TCP_HOST=news-15.net       # A known spam-friendly ISP.
TCP_PORT=80                # Port 80 is http.
  
# Try to connect. (Somewhat similar to a 'ping' . . .) 
echo "HEAD / HTTP/1.0" >/dev/tcp/${TCP_HOST}/${TCP_PORT}
MYEXIT=$?

: <<EXPLANATION
If bash was compiled with --enable-net-redirections, it has the capability of
using a special character device for both TCP and UDP redirections. These
redirections are used identically as STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR. The device entries
are 30,36 for /dev/tcp:

  mknod /dev/tcp c 30 36

>From the bash reference:
/dev/tcp/host/port
    If host is a valid hostname or Internet address, and port is an integer
port number or service name, Bash attempts to open a TCP connection to the
corresponding socket.
EXPLANATION

   
if [ "X$MYEXIT" = "X0" ]; then

Notes
[1]	
The entries in /dev provide mount points for physical and virtual devices. These entries use very little drive space.

Some devices, such as /dev/null, /dev/zero, and /dev/urandom are virtual. They are not actual physical devices and exist only in software.

[2]	
A block device reads and/or writes data in chunks, or blocks, in contrast to a character device, which acesses data in character units. Examples of block devices are hard drives, CDROM drives, and flash drives. Examples of character devices are keyboards, modems, sound cards.

[3]	
Of course, the mount point /mnt/flashdrive must exist. If not, then, as root, mkdir /mnt/flashdrive.

To actually mount the drive, use the following command: mount /mnt/flashdrive

Newer Linux distros automount flash drives in the /media directory without user intervention.

Note	
It is even possible to control certain peripherals with commands sent to the /proc directory.
	  root# echo on > /proc/acpi/ibm/light
          
This turns on the Thinklight in certain models of IBM/Lenovo Thinkpads. (May not work on all Linux distros.)

Of course, caution is advised when writing to /proc.


The /proc directory contains subdirectories with unusual numerical names. Every one of these names maps to the process ID of a currently running process. Within each of these subdirectories, there are a number of files that hold useful information about the corresponding process. The stat and status files keep running statistics on the process, the cmdline file holds the command-line arguments the process was invoked with, and the exe file is a symbolic link to the complete path name of the invoking process. There are a few more such files, but these seem to be the most interesting from a scripting standpoint.

Example 29-3. Finding the process associated with a PID

#!/bin/bash
# pid-identifier.sh:
# Gives complete path name to process associated with pid.

ARGNO=1  # Number of arguments the script expects.
E_WRONGARGS=65
E_BADPID=66
E_NOSUCHPROCESS=67
E_NOPERMISSION=68
PROCFILE=exe

if [ $# -ne $ARGNO ]
then
  echo "Usage: `basename $0` PID-number" >&2  # Error message >stderr.
  exit $E_WRONGARGS
fi  

pidno=$( ps ax | grep $1 | awk '{ print $1 }' | grep $1 )
# Checks for pid in "ps" listing, field #1.
# Then makes sure it is the actual process, not the process invoked by this script.
# The last "grep $1" filters out this possibility.
#
#    pidno=$( ps ax | awk '{ print $1 }' | grep $1 )
#    also works, as Teemu Huovila, points out.

if [ -z "$pidno" ]  #  If, after all the filtering, the result is a zero-length string,
then                #+ no running process corresponds to the pid given.
  echo "No such process running."
  exit $E_NOSUCHPROCESS
fi  

# Alternatively:
#   if ! ps $1 > /dev/null 2>&1
#   then                # no running process corresponds to the pid given.
#     echo "No such process running."
#     exit $E_NOSUCHPROCESS
#    fi

# To simplify the entire process, use "pidof".


if [ ! -r "/proc/$1/$PROCFILE" ]  # Check for read permission.
then
  echo "Process $1 running, but..."
  echo "Can't get read permission on /proc/$1/$PROCFILE."
  exit $E_NOPERMISSION  # Ordinary user can't access some files in /proc.
fi  

# The last two tests may be replaced by:
#    if ! kill -0 $1 > /dev/null 2>&1 # '0' is not a signal, but
                                      # this will test whether it is possible
                                      # to send a signal to the process.
#    then echo "PID doesn't exist or you're not its owner" >&2
#    exit $E_BADPID
#    fi



exe_file=$( ls -l /proc/$1 | grep "exe" | awk '{ print $11 }' )
# Or       exe_file=$( ls -l /proc/$1/exe | awk '{print $11}' )
#
#  /proc/pid-number/exe is a symbolic link
#+ to the complete path name of the invoking process.

if [ -e "$exe_file" ]  #  If /proc/pid-number/exe exists,
then                   #+ then the corresponding process exists.
  echo "Process #$1 invoked by $exe_file."
else
  echo "No such process running."
fi  


#  This elaborate script can *almost* be replaced by
#       ps ax | grep $1 | awk '{ print $5 }'
#  However, this will not work...
#+ because the fifth field of 'ps' is argv[0] of the process,
#+ not the executable file path.
#
# However, either of the following would work.
#       find /proc/$1/exe -printf '%l\n'
#       lsof -aFn -p $1 -d txt | sed -ne 's/^n//p'

awk '{ print $1 }' )

# Finding the process number of 'pppd', the 'ppp daemon'.
# Have to filter out the process lines generated by the search itself.
#
#  However, as Oleg Philon points out,
#+ this could have been considerably simplified by using "pidof".
#  pidno=$( pidof $PROCNAME )
#
#  Moral of the story:
#+ When a command sequence gets too complex, look for a shortcut.


if [ -z "$pidno" ]   # If no pid, then process is not running.
then
  echo "Not connected."
# exit $NOTCONNECTED
else
  echo "Connected."; echo
fi

while [ true ]       # Endless loop, script can be improved here.
do

  if [ ! -e "/proc/$pidno/$PROCFILENAME" ]
  # While process running, then "status" file exists.
  then
    echo "Disconnected."
#   exit $NOTCONNECTED
  fi

netstat -s | grep "packets received"  # Get some connect statistics.
netstat -s | grep "packets delivered"


  sleep $INTERVAL
  echo; echo

done

exit 0

# As it stands, this script must be terminated with a Control-C.

#    Exercises:
#    ---------
#    Improve the script so it exits on a "q" keystroke.
#    Make the script more user-friendly in other ways.
#    Fix the script to work with wireless/DSL connections.

Warning	
In general, it is dangerous to write to the files in /proc, as this can corrupt the filesystem or crash the machine.

Notes
[1]	
Certain system commands, such as procinfo, free, vmstat, lsdev, and uptime do this as well.
